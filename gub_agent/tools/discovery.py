  list_ideas  — search the ideas memory (pitched creative concepts)

    Discover WHAT a named thing is by fuzzy-matching it across every kind of org
    entity at once — accounts, campaigns, campaign pieces, ideas, and staff —
    ranked by similarity.

    USE THIS FIRST whenever the user names something specific and you don't
    already know its type or id. You usually CAN'T tell from the name alone
    whether "BHAC Character Generator" is a campaign, a piece, or an idea — so
    search for it, read the top typed hit(s), then fetch detail with the tool
    that matches the winning `type`:
      type "account"  → get_account_overview(id)
      type "campaign" → get_campaign(id)
      type "piece"    → get_piece(id)
      type "idea"     → get_idea(id)
      type "staff"    → get_staff_profile(id)

    Examples:
    - "how's the BHAC Character Generator?" → find(query="BHAC Character Generator")
    - "what's the latest on Super Cruise?"  → find(query="Super Cruise")

    Args:
        query: The name or phrase the user mentioned.

    Returns:
        A list of hits, each { type, id, name, similarity, parentId }, ranked by
        similarity across all entity types. `type` tells you which detail tool to
        call; `parentId` is the account id (for a campaign) or the campaign id
        (for a piece). An empty list means nothing matched — say so, don't guess.

    """
    Get a campaign piece — a distinct thing the campaign produced or is producing
    (a commercial, social series, tool, activation) — bundled with its
    SURROUNDING CAMPAIGN.

    Asking about a piece pulls in the campaign it lives in automatically, so you
    can answer with the piece's own status AND its campaign context. Resolve a
    piece id first with `find` (or org_query entity='pieces'), or pick it from a
    campaign's piece-stub list. For campaign assessments, fetch the RELEVANT
    pieces (usually the most recent few from the campaign's stub list) with
    parallel get_piece calls in one round.

    Args:
        piece_id: The UUID of the piece (from find / org_query / a campaign's
            piece stubs).

    Returns:
        dict { piece, campaign }. `piece.statusMarkdown` is the piece's full
        status; `campaign` is the surrounding campaign dossier (no sibling
        pieces). Treat statusMarkdown as authoritative status prose.

    Search the IDEAS memory — the agency's institutional record of pitched
    creative CONCEPTS (mined only from pitch and creative-review decks). Each
    idea is a concept described by `facets` (natural-language rows), with a
    `pitchedAt` date and an `awarded` flag (true once it was produced).

    This is CONCEPT memory, not a plain list — the point is "have we already
    pitched something like X?". YOU do the concept matching: call this with
    whatever structured filters narrow the field, then read the returned
    `facets` and pick the ideas that match the concept the user meant BY MEANING.

    All filters are OPTIONAL and combine:
    - "what have we pitched Chevy this year?" → account_id=<chevy>, since="2026-01-01"
    - "have we pitched a loyalty program before?" → no filters; match by meaning
    - "ideas on the Silverado campaign" → campaign_id=<silverado>

    Args:
        account_id: UUID of an account to scope to (resolve via find/list_accounts).
        campaign_id: UUID of a campaign to scope to.
        since: ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) lower bound on pitchedAt.
        until: ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) upper bound on pitchedAt.

    Returns:
