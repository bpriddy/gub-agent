org_query.py — structured query tool for the GUB org data.

A single tool that exposes the GUB query engine (POST /org/query) with
discrete operator modules. Use this for any question that requires
filtering, sorting, counting, grouping, or aggregating across campaigns,
accounts, or staff. Prefer this over fetching lists and reasoning over
them with prose — the LLM is bad at counting and sorting; the database
is good at it.

    Execute a structured query against GUB org data. THE preferred tool for
    any question involving filtering, counting, sorting, ranking, or
    aggregation — the database does these reliably; do NOT do them yourself.

    ## Entities

    - "campaigns" — agency work for a client account
    - "pieces" — campaign pieces: distinct produced/producing executions within
      a campaign (a commercial, social series, tool, activation). Query these to
      RESOLVE a piece by name (`{name: {similar_to: "..."}}`) or list a campaign's
      pieces (`{campaignId: {eq: "..."}}`); the rich status is NOT here — fetch
      it with get_piece(id). Usually easier: use `find` when you don't yet know
      the thing is a piece.
    - "accounts" — clients of the agency
    - "staff" — people at the agency

    Use a separate call per entity. For multi-entity questions, chain
    queries (see "Composition" below).

    ## Filter operators

    Each filter is `{field: {op: value}}`. ONE operator per field per call.
    AND across multiple fields. For OR/range, use `in` or `between`.

      eq          {status: {eq: "live"}}                equals
      neq         {status: {neq: "complete"}}           not equals
      in          {status: {in: ["live", "awarded"]}}   value in list
      gt, gte     {budget: {gte: 100000}}               >, >=
      lt, lte     {budget: {lt: 50000}}                 <, <=
      between     {awardedAt: {between: ["2025-01-01","2025-12-31"]}}
      like        {name: {like: "%nike%"}}              SQL ILIKE substring
      similar_to  {name: {similar_to: "chevy"}}         pg_trgm fuzzy match —
                                                        matches Chevrolet, Chevy Trucks, etc.
                                                        USE THIS for fuzzy name lookups.

                                                        filter; chain follow-ups by `id.in`.
      is_null     {endsAt: {is_null: true}}             field IS / IS NOT NULL

    ## Sort

    `[{field: "budget", direction: "desc"}, ...]`. Multi-key allowed.
    May also sort by an aggregate output name (see Aggregate).

    ## Group-by + aggregate (analytics)

    `group_by: ["status"]` groups results by that field. Multi-axis grouping
    is supported: `group_by: ["status", "industry"]` → one row per
    combination.
    `aggregate: {<outputName>: {op: "count"|"sum"|"avg"|"min"|"max", field?: "budget"}}`
    MULTIPLE aggregates in one call are supported — one output name each:
    `aggregate: {n: {op: "count"}, spend: {op: "sum", field: "budget"}}`.

    `count` takes no field. `sum/avg/min/max` require a numeric or date field.
    Group-by without explicit aggregate implicitly counts.

    Result rows shape: `{<group_field(s)>: value, <outputName>: number, ...}`,
    and `sort` may reference any aggregate output name (e.g. sort by `spend`
    desc, limit 5 → top-5 ranking computed in the DB).

    RULE: for portfolio/analytics questions, prefer ONE rich org_query
    (multiple aggregates, multi-axis group_by, sort by aggregate) over many
    small calls.

    CLOSURE: the grouped/aggregated rows ARE the answer to a comparison,
    breakdown, or "how do X vs Y differ" question — synthesize directly from
    them. Do NOT then fetch individual accounts, campaigns, or staff to
    "enrich" a comparison: that re-introduces the per-entity fan-out the
    aggregate just replaced. Drill into a single entity only if the user
    asked about that specific one.

    ## Limit + total

    `limit` caps the returned rows (default 50, max 100). The response includes
    `total` — the REAL DB count of matching rows independent of `limit`. USE
    `total` FOR ANY "HOW MANY" QUESTION. Never count items in the `results`
    array yourself.

    ## Composition for multi-entity questions

    org_query handles ONE entity per call. For multi-entity questions, chain
    queries using `in` as the join primitive:

      "Most expensive campaign for Chevy this year"
      1) org_query(entity="accounts", filter={name: {similar_to: "chevy"}}, limit=5)
         → pick the right accountId from the candidates
      2) org_query(
           entity="campaigns",
           filter={
             accountId: {eq: <that account's id>},
             awardedAt: {between: ["2025-01-01","2025-12-31"]}
           },
           sort=[{field: "budget", direction: "desc"}],
           limit=1
         )

      "Staff who led campaigns over $1M for auto accounts"
      1) accounts where industry=auto → ids A
      2) campaigns where accountId in A and budget > 1M → distinct createdBy ids S
      3) staff where id in S → names

    ## Worked examples

      # "How many campaigns for Chevy?"
      org_query(entity="accounts", filter={name: {similar_to: "chevy"}}, limit=5)
      # ... pick Chevrolet's id ...
      org_query(entity="campaigns",
                filter={accountId: {eq: "..."}},
                aggregate={count: {op: "count"}})
      # → results: [{count: 7}], total: 1

      # "Top 5 accounts by campaign count" — top-N by aggregate: rank in the
      # DB by sorting on the aggregate OUTPUT NAME. Extra aggregates ride
      # along in the same call.
      org_query(entity="campaigns",
                group_by=["accountId"],
                aggregate={campaignCount: {op: "count"},
                           totalBudget: {op: "sum", field: "budget"}},
                sort=[{field: "campaignCount", direction: "desc"}],
                limit=5)
      # → [{accountId: "...", campaignCount: 9, totalBudget: 4200000}, ...]
      # then ONE follow-up accounts query with id in [...] for names.

      # "Who owns the most accounts?" — same top-N pattern on accounts
      org_query(entity="accounts",
                group_by=["ownerStaffId"],
                aggregate={accountCount: {op: "count"}},
                sort=[{field: "accountCount", direction: "desc"}],
                limit=5)
      # → then ONE staff query with id in [...] for names. TWO calls total.

      # "How do active vs prospect vs inactive accounts differ?" — one
      # multi-axis call gives the whole comparison grid; do NOT query each
      # status separately.
      org_query(entity="accounts",
                group_by=["status", "industry"],
                aggregate={accounts: {op: "count"}},
                sort=[{field: "accounts", direction: "desc"}])
      # → [{status: "active", industry: "auto", accounts: 4}, ...]

      # "Portfolio rollup: volume, spend, and recency per account" — SEVERAL
      # metrics per group in ONE call
      org_query(entity="campaigns",
                group_by=["accountId", "status"],
                aggregate={n: {op: "count"},
                           spend: {op: "sum", field: "budget"},
                           avgBudget: {op: "avg", field: "budget"},
                           latestEnd: {op: "max", field: "endsAt"}},
                sort=[{field: "spend", direction: "desc"}])
      # → one row per (account, status) with all four metrics attached.

      # "Total budget awarded last year"
      org_query(entity="campaigns",
                filter={awardedAt: {between: ["2025-01-01","2025-12-31"]}},
                aggregate={total: {op: "sum", field: "budget"}})

      # "Live campaigns sorted by budget"
      org_query(entity="campaigns",
                filter={status: {eq: "live"}},
                sort=[{field: "budget", direction: "desc"}],
                limit=20)

    ## What this tool deliberately does NOT do

    - No native joins. Use chained queries with `in` as shown above.
    - No text search over status markdown / notes / metadata. Those are
      conversational context — fetch the specific entity by id with the
      existing detail tools (get_campaign / get_account_overview) and read.
    - No staff metadata (skills, certifications). Use
      `find_staff_for_resourcing` for resourcing questions.

    Args:
        entity: One of "campaigns", "accounts", "staff".
        filter: Map of field -> {operator: value}. Optional.
        sort: List of {field, direction: "asc"|"desc"}. Optional.
        group_by: List of fields to group rows by. Optional.
        aggregate: Map of output-name -> {op, field?}. Optional.
        limit: Max rows to return (default 50, max 100). Optional.

    Returns:
        {results: [...], total: int, truncated: bool}
        - results: the row list (entity rows or aggregate/group rows).
        - total: the REAL count of matching rows in the DB, NOT len(results).
        - truncated: True if limit cut off some rows.
