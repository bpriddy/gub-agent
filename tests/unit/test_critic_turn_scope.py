"""
The critic's deterministic facts are about THIS turn (thread-topics).

`_executor_made_tool_call` and `_last_executor_text` read session events, and
session events are never trimmed: a thread keeps every turn it has ever had.
Unfiltered, both scans reached back into earlier turns —

- a tool call from ANY earlier turn made the critic read "TOOL CALL THIS TURN:
  yes", which switches off its "you answered from memory" guard for the rest of
  the session;
- a turn whose executor produced no text read the PREVIOUS answer instead, so
  the format gate could ship it as this turn's and CriticGate could skip the
  critic because an earlier turn had abstained.

Both now filter on the current invocation id. Built on a REAL ADK
InvocationContext (tests/helpers.py), because the invocation id is the thing
under test and a fake would supply whatever the test assumed.
