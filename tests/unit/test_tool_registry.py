"""
tools.ALL_TOOLS — what the executor is offered, pinned.

Nothing asserted the contents of this list until search-01, and until then
nothing needed to: a tool dropped from it would have made answers worse, but
only this repo's answers. `find_files` changed that. gub-gchat-bot reads the
file list straight off the function RESPONSE, keyed on the tool NAME — so a
rename or a removal here empties a section of another repo's UI with no error
raised anywhere, in either repo. That failure deserves a test that fails first.

The set is pinned whole rather than just checking `find_files` is in it: the
point is that changing the offered tools becomes a deliberate edit with a test
diff attached, not a side effect of tidying an import.
