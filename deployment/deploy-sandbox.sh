# deploy-sandbox.sh — deploy this working tree to the SANDBOX Agent Engine.
#
# Same package as production, different env: the sandbox engine is deployed
# with deploy-sandbox.env, which turns SANDBOX_ENABLED on (and EMIT_THINKING with
# it). Isolation is a property of the deploy, not of caller discipline — an
# experiment aimed at the sandbox cannot reach the engine serving the Chat bot
# because that engine has the flag off and ignores state["sandbox"] entirely.
#
# Deliberately does NOT call deployment/register_agent.py: the sandbox engine
# must never appear in the Gemini Enterprise agent list, or real users would be
# routed to whatever prompt an experiment left behind.
#
# Usage:
#   deployment/deploy-sandbox.sh                       # create or update
#   deployment/deploy-sandbox.sh "what changed"        # with a description
#
# First run creates a new engine and prints its ID; record it in deploy-sandbox.env
# as SANDBOX_AGENT_ENGINE_ID so later runs update in place instead of creating
# (and billing for) another one.
